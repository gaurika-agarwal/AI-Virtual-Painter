This project implements an AI Virtual Painter using Python and OpenCV. The application allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures captured through a webcam.

Features

Hand Tracking: Utilizes the hand_tracking_module to detect and track hand gestures in real-time.
Gesture Recognition: Recognizes gestures to switch between drawing mode and selection mode.
Color Selection: Allows users to select different drawing colors by hovering over predefined color regions on the screen.
Brush Thickness Control: Enables users to adjust the brush thickness for drawing strokes.
Canvas Interaction: Provides functionalities for drawing, erasing, and switching between different drawing modes.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
OpenCV library (pip install --upgrade opencv-python)
Mediapipe library(python -m pip install mediapipe)
hand_tracking_module.py
